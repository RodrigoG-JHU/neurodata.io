          desc: |
            The co-founder of the ``Open Connectome Project'' (OCP), for several years, I was the only neuroscientist that could easily store, manage, and analyze very big datasets, spanning first tens of terabytes, and then hundreds.  For that reason, I was an essential co-author on a number of big data papers. Specifically, though I sometimes contributed relatively little to the scientific ideas, I often was required to complete, visualize, and/or share the data. Perhaps more importantly, both funding agencies and journals began mandating that these large datasets be publicly shared, and OCP was literally the only option. This is despite often not having funding, nor being a co-author, on the manuscripts

            Our lab co-founded the https://registry.opendata.aws/open-neurodata/
            Registry of Open Data on Amazon Web Serivces (AWS). The implication of this is that now, pending a few minor considerations, any neuroscientist that collects large image data can deposit it online for free. This means that neither they nor we must request funding to store the data. Our lab maintains this repository, but only by virtue of ensuring instructions for uploading, visualizing, and downloading are up to date, and acting as a gatekeeper to ensure only appropriate data are deposited there
