        NeuroData is literally always hiring exceptional individuals. If you think
        you'd like to work with us in any capacity, please contact us now! Some
        thoughts that might be useful prior to emailing us to consider further:
    </p>

        <li>
            We recognize the unique struggles Black, Indigenous, People of Color
            (BIPOC) and women face in Academia, particularly STEM, and are committed
            to creating a environment where they feel supported and appreciated. We
            are interested in all kinds of people with <em>all</em>
            kinds of backgrounds, we do not discriminate for any reason, and we are
            all students at different stages. Please see our
            <a href="https://neurodata.io/about/codeofconduct/">code of conduct</a>
            for more details.
        </li>

        <li>
            We believe that to maximally flourish requires being in the appropriate
            environment specifically for <em>you</em>. Each individual benefits from
            unique circumstances. We wrote this
            <a href="https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/08/31/sig-and-feas.html">blog post</a>
            which describes out thoughts on choosing projects, but it is also relevant
            for choosing teams. If you are reading this far, it seems likely that the
            kind of work we do is intrinsically motivating for you. Even if not, and
            you think we could help find a team better aligned with your dreams,
            please contact us.
        </li>

        <li>
            To create the most peaceful and productive environment, our team has
            constructed these
            <a href="https://neurodata.io/about/agreements/">agreements</a>, which we
            all adhere to. This includes treating everyone with respect on the team,
            and at any team events. See our
            <a href="https://neurodata.io/about/codeofconduct/">code of conduct</a>
            for details. If it seems like that kind of environment would suit you
            well, please contact us.

            If you are interested in pursuing graduate studies with us, there are many
            different programs that are available. The
            <a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/graduate/overview/">Johns Hopkins University Biomedical Engineering
                graduate programs</a>
            are the most common approach, which includes the
            <a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/academics/graduate/masters-programs/masters-program/">MSE</a>
            and
            <a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/graduate/phd/overview/">PhD</a>
            programs, as well as a few others (<a
                href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/graduate/tsinghua-jhu-dual-degree-ms-program/overview/">Tsinghua JHU-BME
                dual degree</a>
            and
            <a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/graduate/md-phd/">MD/PhD</a>). Note that
            BME@JHU is the #1 rated BME graduate school in the world according to
            <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/biomedical-rankings">US News
                &amp; World Reports</a>. I also sometimes advise students in
            <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/graduate-studies/">Computer Science</a>,
            <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/graduate-studies/overview/">Applied Mathematics &amp;
                Statistics</a>,
            <a
                href="https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/academics-and-student-life/degree-programs/">Biostatistics</a>,
            and <a href="http://neuroscience.jhu.edu/graduate">Neuroscience</a>. If
            you are interested in graduate studies with us in a different program
            (e.g.,
            <a href="https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/students-postdocs/joint-graduate-program">JHU/Janelia</a>, or
            <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/graduate-studies/">ECE@JHU</a>),
            please also feel free to contact us.

            If you are already enrolled at JHU and are interested in joining the lab,
            the simplest route is to enroll in the year-long project-based course we
            offer called
            <a href="https://neurodatadesign.io/syllabus/">NeuroData Design</a>. A key motivation for offering
            this course was to ensure that we could
            work with as many amazing individuals as possible. If for some reason,
            enrolling in the course does not seem feasible for you, please contact us
            and we will try to figure out some other arrangement. We also recommend 
            <a href="https://github.com/neurodata/nd-faq/blob/courses/courses.md">these courses</a>
            that should prove useful when working in the lab.
        </li>

        <li>
            If you are a visiting or exchange student, please see
            <a href="https://apply.jhu.edu/visiting-and-exchange-students/">JHU's official exchange program
                overview</a>, and go through the official process; after you do this, contact us to
            say you applied. It is complicated for legal and bureaucratic reasons to
            accept visiting/exchange students outside these official programs,
            although it is possible. So, if those programs do not work for any reason,
            please contact us.

        Dr. Joshua Vogelstein has recently decided to commit his research energy
        almost entirely on trainees and students, and has therefore drastically
        reduced the amount of time he spends on email. Please see below further
        information:
