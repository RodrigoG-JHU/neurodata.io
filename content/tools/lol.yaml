details:
  - "LOL is a robust and powerful for learning lower-dimensional representation in high-dimensional, low sample size setting."

  - 'Currently available in <a href="https://github.com/neurodata/lol">R</a> and <a href="https://github.com/neurodata/lollipop">Python</a>.
    Both packages are currently supported for Linux, MacOS and Windows. FlashLOL, an implementation which uses heavily optimized routines for 
    computation of LOL on datasets with high dimensionality, is available through the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/neurodata/flashlol">FlashLOL docker container</a>.'

  - "LOL is commercial open-source software and released under Apache-2.0 License."
