      I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of <a href="http://www.bme.jhu.edu/">Biomedical Engineering</a> (WSE), 
      with joint appointments in Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Neuroscience, and Biostatistics at 
      <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>. I am affiliated with the <a href="http://www.icm.jhu.edu/">Institute for Computational Medicine</a>, 
      the Center for Imaging Science, and the Kavli Neuroscience Discovery Institute, and is affiliated with the Mathematical Institute for Data Science and Institute for 
       Data Intensive Engineering and Sciences.

       My research is devoted to developing and applying biomedical data science theory and methods. This typically includes dealing 
       with high-dimensional, nonlinear, structured data with low-sample sizes. I developed the leading machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) methods and 
       software tools for managing large imaging data, as well as the state-of-the-art multivariate hypothesis testing, clustering, and classification techniques. My work 
       primarily focuses on brain data, including brain networks, anatomy, physiology, and behavior/cognition. Recently my lab has also focused on COVID-19, including 
       real-world evidence with causal inference, as well as addressing current bottlenecks in AI development, such as lifelong learning. My research goal is to understand and 
       improve animal and machine learning worldwide. I am passionate about democratizing science at all levels, and is deeply engaged in education and outreach, as well as research.

    I received a BS from the Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) at Washington University in St. Louis, MO in 2002, a M.S. degree from the Department 
    of Applied Mathematics and Statistics (AMS) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in Baltimore, MD in 2009, and a Ph.D. degree from the Department of 
    Neuroscience at JHU in 2009. I then also trained in AMS@JHU from 2009 until 2012, and then Duke departments of Mathematics and Statistical Science until 2014. 
    I married my kindergarten sweetheart in the summer of 2014, and we had our first child in 2017, and a second in 2019.

    My research has been featured in a number of prominent scientific and engineering journals and conferences including Nature, Science, Cell, Proceedings of the 
    National Academy of Sciences, Nature Methods, Science Translational Medicine, Journal of Machine Learning, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine 
    Intelligence, Annals of Applied Statistics, Neurips, and SIAM Journal of Matrix Analysis and Applications. In 2011, I initiated <a href="http://ocp.me/">Open Connectome Project</a> (OCP) 
    with my brother R. Jacob Vogelstein and <a href="https://randalburns.github.io/">Randal Burns</a>, Associated Professor in the Department of Computer Science 
    at Johns Hopkins University, and then co-founded Gigantum a few years later. We try to conduct our work according to the highest standards of open science.
