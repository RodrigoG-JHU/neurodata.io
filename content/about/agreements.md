# Commitments

The below commitments are designed to facilitate each of us individually and collectively flourishing. They are in a continual process of refinement; in all aspepcts of life (including work and science), we experiment, learn, and grow. These commitments *augment*, and therefore do not replace, official JHU policies, including:

1. The rights and responsibilities of all JHU students (documented [here](http://web.jhu.edu/administration/provost/docs/Rights_Responsibilities_Final.pdf)). 
2. JHU advisor-PhD student relationships commitments set forth by the [University Provost](https://provost.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/08/JHU-Mentorship-Commitments-of-Faculty-Advisors-and-PhD-Students.pdf). 
3. [University's policies on Academic Freedom](http://web.jhu.edu/administration/provost/initiatives/academicfreedom/AcademicFreedomatJohnsHopkins.pdf).


Joining the lab, which is made official by signing documents with JHU where JHU commits to you, amounts to also agreeing to all of the below core commitments.  If any individual is not acting in a fashion that is in alignment with  these commitments, that indicates that our environment is not adequately supportive of their flourishing, and therefore, we will seek to find something more in alignment with them (which could happen by modifying the commitments, or supporting them to find an opportunity that is more supportive of them).


The expectation is that each of us meet all of these commitments 90% of the time.  


## Principal Investigators


For everybody in [NeuroData](https://neurodata.io/about/team/), for the duration of your tenure as a team member:

### Flourish

> I commit to flow in, and expand, our individual and collective flourishing I commit to supporting all the members of  NeuroData to flow in, and expand, your individual and collective flourishing.  
 
Implicit in this commitment is an acknowledgement that each of us defines flourishing and collective for ourselves, thus I commit to support you in *your* definition of flourishing and collective, not mine. 

### Resources

> I commit to providing the financial, computational, space, and other resources appropriate for your position, potentially including salary, benefits,  computing costs, conference fees, travel expenses, publication fees, a desk, a labtop, monitors,  etc.  

1. Other fees never effect your salary.
2. I will spend at least 1 hour per week in person with each PhD student every week, except for weeks that I am traveling, or the week is short due to academic calendar days off, or a disease/family emergency. 

### Guidance

> I commit to providing direction and guidance to the best of my abilities in support of your growth and maturation as a student, scientist, and conscious being.  

At various times, this will translate into me being a:

    1. coach: in which encouragement you & facilitate self-empowerment,
    2. challenger: in which I catalyze you to take action,
    3. creator: in which I co-create with you to manifest our desired outcomes. 

This commitment includes me *not* being any of the following:

    1. victim: in which I fail to take responsibility for my part of outcomes,
    1. villain: in which I blame others for various outcomes,
    2. hero: in which I seek temporary relief, rather than empowerment.  

### Diversity

> I commit to maintaining lab diversity. 


This includes actively recruiting lab members spanning levels, specifically including individuals with various sex, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, marital status, pregnancy,  disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, political views, veteran status, experience or lack of, or other historically and contemporaneously marginalized identities.  


### Modeling

> I commit to modeling the way.

These means that I will act in a fashion that I believe is in aligment with our commitments, in an effort to provide an example for you for one way that acting in aligment with these commitments can look.  And, I understand that manifesting these commitments will look different for each person.



## NeuroData 

The following commitments and agreements apply to all current members of  [NeuroData](https://neurodata.io/about/team/), Jovo included.


### Genius

> I commit to focusing the majority of my research [energy](http://a.co/aPrBEkq) on a few projects in my  [zone of genius](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S7L6FV2?ref=KC_GS_GB_US), and to support and inspire others to fully express their creativity and live in their zone of genius.

Abiding by this commitment requires assessing your zone of genius. Note that this commitment leaves plenty of room to work on non-lab stuff, and play. 


####  Alignment

> I commit to focus my primary research project(s) on work that aligns with our mission, our resources/expertise, and my genius. 


See [how to choose a project](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/08/31/sig-and-feas.html) for more tips on how to choose a project. In general, the expectation is that each project  takes about one year to sufficiently complete to make public (e.g., post to arXiv), and is complete when the manuscript is published in a journal/conference. 


#### Open, Accessible, & Reproducible Science

> I commit to conducting my work using the highest standards for open, accessible, and reproducible science. 

This commitment leads to all of our research derivatives being open, accessible and reproducible, including code, data, data derivatives, publications, talks, posters, etc. At the highest level, our work is open throughout the entire scientific process. Note that external collaborators may have other commitments, and so are committed to always work to be in alignment with their commitments and ours. 



#### Honesty

> I commit to speaking inarguably/impeccably, including acknowledging all authentic feelings, expressing the inarguble truth, and only making [impeccable agreements](http://www.toltecspirit.com/four-agreements/impeccable-word/). 

This means, for example, that we use "I" statements, such as "I heard X", rather than "You said X", and "My judgement of you is that you are X", rather than "You are X".  Honesty demands an appropriate level of epistemic humility. 


#### Play

> I commit to play by honoring rest, renewal and rhythm.

Stuart Brown defines play in his book as “an absorbing, apparently purposeless activity that provides enjoyment and suspends self-consciousness and a sense of time. It is also self-motivating and makes you want to do it again.”

Manifestations of play include participating in daily recess (3pm daily on school days), and/or other regular social/playful events.  



#### Diversity and Inclusion 

> I commit to co-creating a safe, comfortable, and [brave](https://www.naspa.org/images/uploads/main/Policy_and_Practice_No_2_Safe_Brave_Spaces.pdf)  space, and harassment-free experience (see [wikipedia's definition of harrassment for details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harassment)), for **everyone**.

This commitment holds regardless of any individual's 
sex,
gender,
gender identity and expression,
age,
sexual orientation,
marital status, pregnancy, 
disability,
physical appearance,
body size,
race,
ethnicity,
nationality,
religion,
political or other views,
veteran status,
experience or lack of,
or other historically and contemporaneously marginalized identity. 
We recognize the unique struggles of being a member of a marginalized community (and all the more so for individuals that are members of multiple such communities) in STEM. And we recognize ways in which we may benefit from and/or contribute to marginalization of certain groups. 



#### Feedback

> I commit to seeking, gathering, appreciating, and learning from feedback. I commit authentically and consciously offering feedback. 


The model for feedback we use is the Conscious Leadership Group's [clearing model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3o2js6vme2zh3fu/CLG-Clearing%20Model.pdf?dl=1).  It is often best practice to provide such feedback in private.  Feedback for Jovo can be provided directly in the #jovofeedback slack channel, the [anonymous feedback form](https://forms.gle/6CZDgEHKuUhWh8Su7), or by scheduling a [one-on-one meeting]((https://calendly.com/joshuav)) with Jovo (the preferred format).


# Recommended Practices

## Code

NeuroData recommendations for code contributing code to widely used open-source libraries, include:

  1. Be a member of the [`neurodata`](https://github.com/neurodata) organization on Github, and make my membership status public.
  4. Follow [FIRM standards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MEloi0hGa8IhwxE-HXdklAUoftTJGw-E_VliEqez150/edit?usp=sharing). 
  2. Preface your issue or devlist email with the following:

    - My name is [name here] and I am a member of @neurodata of Johns Hopkins University. We design, build, study, and apply statistical machine learning and big data science techniques, and are highly active in the open source community. You can find a list of our open source contributions [here](https://neurodata.io/code/). 


We believe that following these steps will add credibility to the contribution, and make it more likely for the issue/PR  to be reviewed/accepted. 

## Papers

NeuroData recommendations for papers are as follows: 
1. Follow the [recommended guidelines](https://bitsandbrains.io/2019/02/10/how-to-write-a-paper.html) for writing papers.
2. When it is time to start writing a paper, clone our [latex template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mnmbyrtgphkp) overleaf repo, invite Jovo to it and make him owner so that compilation goes faster and we can track changes. 
2. Share the pre-print with co-authors at least one week in advance of planning to post/submit it. If for some reason a lab member cannot be reached during this time, there is no need to wait for them. 
3. Track changes (see below for details)
4. Post/submit when you feel ready, regardless of the feedback (or lack thereof), even from Jovo. 
5. Be aware that collaborators outside the lab may have other practices, and seek to achieve win-for-all solutions where everybody is in alignment with all decisions. 
6. When we are middle authors, consider proactively inquiring about their lab practices and seek to agree to a procedure that is in alignment for all stakeholders. 
7. Encourage and support all co-authors to have access to the final submitted manuscript.



For tracking changes, considering adding comments as: 

% TODO blah blah ---jovo

This enables everyone to easily find all the comments, including if they are editing locally (or simply not in the overleaf web app). When feedback is provided, it is important to address every single comment *in the text itself*. Recall: the author of a manuscript is literally the least qualified person in the world to ascertain whether what that person has written is *clear to other people*, which is the question at hand. Therefore, if you are the author, and you think it was clear, *you are wrong*, in that it certainly was not clear to at least one person that cares. 



### Internal communication

All data we get in the world is feedback for us, and so the opportunity to learn and grow from each interaction is ever present.  *Receiving* feedback with curiousity and openness, however, can often be a challenge.  Similarly, providing explicit feedback to others can also be a challenge, partially because you may not want to offend them, partially because we are not trained to offer or receive feedback consciously.  

Consciously offering feedback includes owning my projections and my responsibility for co-creating this situation, and specifically offering it directly to the person(s) with whom the feedback is about, only if they explicit acknowledge that they are ready for it.
Consciously receiving feedback includes understanding that whoever is offering feedback is projecting somewhat, and *partially* responsible for co-creating this situation, and so are you. It also includes only receiving feedback directly about you, unless there are extenuating circumstances, and only when you are ready. 


### External communication

Contacting people outside the lab with questions is effectively asking them to spend their limited time helping us for free. Since we would prefer to be the ones offering help rather than receiving it, we recommend, prior to asking them for help, to:

  1. Consider what it would take for us to solve our problem without their help (this means searching the literature, exploring and writing code, reading books, etc).
  2. Consider what it would take for peers within the lab to help with our problem (this means asking labmates for help or literature recommendations, or asking jovo for help or literature recommendations).
  3. Make a judgement call that the ratio of the effort required in #1 or #2 to the effort required to contact someone outside the lab is high enough to justify the potential cost to their time.

If we do have to ask people outside the lab questions, clarify to them the extent to which we are grateful for their time, and that we have exhausted our internal resources prior to reaching out. Any questions we ask are about pointing us in the right direction, rather than asking for a time to speak with them.

Reach out to potential collaborators when we find any information that may be useful for the lab, such as algorithms or public code we want to incorporate into our package. Invite them to co-author any papers we produce, and in general include them in our community. 

### Video conferencing

Use closed captioning technology when presenting our work virtually, whenever possible. Videoconference technology can make it especially hard for deaf, hard of hearing, and/or non-native English speakers to understand speech. Such technology is available on Google slides, and Microsoft Office 365. In order to make this practice maximally effective, we strive to:

- keep captioning on even during question and answer periods
- link audio output to input, so the captioning can pick up speech from the audience. This can be done by playing audio out loud through computer speakers, or by using software such as [this](https://webcaptioner.com/help/integrations/captioning-audio-from-another-program-microphone).


##  Lab Meetings, slides, and other presentations


1. **Practice** before getting in front of other people, because every minute you speak you have implicitly asked many other people to devote to you, so please be respectful of other people's time. 
2. Plan to present your work internally about 2x / year. 
3. If you just join the lab, sign up for the beginning of the queue [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pysmRprg6r2ToyddZhNx3AqCHm2aeHUy949h4KkcQso/edit?usp=sharing), and present your life story while wearing a funny hat. Team members can sign up for a slot.
4. When making slides to present to other lab members, use either our [google slides folder](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HLuQK7uNnhfiWO44a_XTMZMNag1KrjJgNNYtyXUuaG8/edit?usp=sharing), or use some markdown presentation system (such as [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) or [marp](https://marp.app/) (which also has [vs code integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode)), and commit the slides to your repo.



# Activities

#### Annual Group Hangouts

To build community and deeper inter-personal connections, and to have fun, we agree to having annual activities like going to dinner as a team. These occasions will include a celebration of past successes, as well as a discussion of collective goals for the subsequent year. These occasions will be organized by trainees.


#### Semi-Annual No JoVo Meeting

We will meet at least 2x annual without jovo to discuss ways we can collectively improve the lab, and provide detailed and [radically candid](https://www.radicalcandor.com/) feedback.


#### Annual Reviews

We agree to annual reviews, to document goals and assess trajectory, by filling out either the following [questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/U5relYG8tV3fECqL2), or the BME PhD student questionnaire, annually, and then scheduling a meeting with Jovo to discuss. These meetings will typically happen in July. 

#### Agreements update

We agree to update these Agreements as appropriate.


# Research Artifacts 

We agree to the contributing to the following research artifacts, depending on the "stage" of our careers, and our career objectives. We have different milestones and deliverables, but annual productivity is a crucial component of any career development.

##### Publications

- *MSE thesis students* and *Research staff*: submit a first author publication each year
- *PhD students*: submit a first author publication once per each of the last three years of the PhD
- *Postdocs*: submit a first author publication once per year

> Quotes can be a useful device in adding style or establishing context in scientific writing, so we fully support and encourage including quotes in our papers; and, we aspire to include quotes from individuals with diverse backgrounds who live(d) the highest moral standards and serve as role models for us. At the same time, we acknowledge that quotes can come across as an endorsement of the personal life of the author. Therefore, quotes should be carefully chosen and considered by all authors of a paper. Any quote from a non-scientist will be held to a very high moral standard. 

##### Conferences

We agree to present at >=1 conference per year to get feedback, network, and professional development. Any conferences one desires to attend is fine, conditional on

- applying to present your work via some mechanism (posters, talks, or boothing), and
- for conferences with proceedings, a "submission ready" draft is provided >= 1 month prior to submission deadline, or
- for conferences with posters, a "presentation ready" poster is provided >= 2 weeks prior to the event.

##### Grants

We (postdocs) agree to apply for funding each year, targeting a solicitation >2 months in advance. 

We (anybody using "extensive" commercial cloud computing (>$1,000/month)) will write a AWS Research credits grant at least annually for <$10,000. 


#### Departure Agreements

We agree to make a 'transition' plan no later than 3 months prior to departure, wherein the technical expertise we have acquired in the lab is transferred to at least one individual in the lab. This includes, 
- If we have written a numerical package, that the core components of it are integrated into another package, so maintanence is no longer dependent on us;
- A plan for how to address completing papers that are not yet 'done' (where done means we've already sent proofs back). This includes identifying an indivudal who will be the point of contact for future correspondence with journals, etc. Authorship inclusion and order may change in this process, including elevating/relegating to/from first author, as deemed appropriate by the corresponding author. 

#### Authorship Agreements

Typically, the person actually submitting the paper is the first author. This means that sometimes, if we get feedback after an individual has left the lab, and that person decides to prioritize other work, the 2nd author may be responsible for resubmitting, and the author order may switch accordingly.

#### Communication

The primary ways for a NeuroData member to contact Jovo is at their weekly 1-on-1 in person meetings. Time permitting, other slots may be available in [calendly](https://calendly.com/joshuav/).


#### Accessibility



#### Summer Community Outreach

We agree to support >= 1 summer student each summer. There are a variety of summer mentorship opportunities in partnership with some Baltimore public education institution (e.g. state university, public high school) that can foster stronger connections with our surrounding community. Examples include:

- ICM Summer Internship with UMBC or Morgan State - [website](https://icm.jhu.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/internships/)
- Mentor student from local college through JHMI Summer Internship Program - [website](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/Opportunities-High-School-Undergraduate-Postbac-Students/)
- Research experience for women in Baltimore City schools through WSE's WISE program - [website](https://engineering.jhu.edu/outreach/get-involved/women-in-science-and-engineering-wise-program/)
- Volunteering at CodeScholar, a summer bootcamp for Baltimore School System students - [website](https://www.codeintheschools.org/codescholar)


#### Recommended Reading on Mentorship and Imposter Syndrome

Mentors can anticipate that many of their mentees may experience imposter syndrome. This can be compounded by stereotype threat and experiences of discrimination that have happened in the past or their current environment (which should be addressed by the team). Mentors can support their mentees (and vice versa) by educating themselves on imposter syndrome’s causes, indications, and counteractive tools or practices. Mentors can thus learn to listen in a new way to their mentees and validate their experiences, to use positive and constructive feedback to affirm their value, to share their own uncertainties and learning process, and to ask if their mentees would like support in connecting with resources such as affinity networks for people with shared experiences or articles with tools for managing imposter syndrome. 

The following resources are recommended to all lab members, especially to those who serve as mentors. They are also encouraged to seek additional resources to learn how to create an equitable and supportive lab environment.

- [mentoring someone with imposter syndrome](https://hbr.org/2019/02/mentoring-someone-with-imposter-syndrome)
- [mitigating imposter syndrome](https://www.usenix.org/blog/impostor-syndrome-proof-yourself-and-your-community)
- [the minority experience and imposter syndrome](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/smarter-living/dealing-with-impostor-syndrome-when-youre-treated-as-an-impostor.html)

### Individual Commitments to Upholding Agreements
Certain agreements require a member of the lab to commit to be an organizer. Each year, a new member of the lab will commit for the following year or until someone else agrees to take responsibility. The following individuals are currently committed to upholding the listed aspects of the lab agreement.

- Weekly lab meeting: Ross
- Semi-annual social events: Ronan
- Semi-annual no-jovo meetings: Pedigo 
- Annual lab trip: Sambit
- Internship outreach and management: Tommy

### Birthday Privileges
On the day of a lab members' birthday, all other members shall refer to them as "Your Supreme Superbity." Also, all lab members must spontaneously breakout into an enthusiastic chicken dance at their command.

# Privileges & Responsibilities

We collectively co-create our community.  Being a part of this community affords us access to many amazing resources.  Associated with access to those resources and privileges are a number of responsibilities.

5. The priviledge of being an official member of the team comes with the responsibility of 
  6. being physically present in the lab 2+ days/week for all full weeks in the academic calendar, modulo vacations, disease, or family emergencies,  
  7. responding to other lab members queries in a timely fashion (e.g., within a week),
  8. posting any papers (in which I am the first author) to a pre-print server no later than the date of submission, and
  9. making any code necessary to reproduce the figures in any paper I write open access no later than the date of submission to pre-print server.
7. If I am priviledged to be funded by a grant, I am responsible for contributing to all grant related responsibilities, including making/giving talks, attending grant meetings, regular reporting, and any other commitments specified in the grant.
8. If I desire computing resources beyond my personal computer, I have the privilege of using CIS/MINDS clusters pending availability.  Prior to using shared resources, I am responsible for running the code on very small datasets to check for veracity. To acquire the priviledge of commercial cloud computing, I am responsible for writing (not winning) an [AWS Cloud Credits for Research grant](https://aws.amazon.com/research-credits/). Request just under $10,000 for small projects, and request up to $100,000 for larger ones. 
11. The priviledge of being a senior member of the team (have successfully submitted >=1 first author peer-reviewed manuscript on our team) comes with the responsibility of accepting a buddy mentee. The responsibility associated with this mentee will be to onboard the mentee. There is lots of literature to suggest this is good for everyone on the team, for example, see [here](https://hbr.org/2018/12/to-retain-new-hires-spend-more-time-onboarding-them) and [here](https://hbr.org/2019/06/every-new-employee-needs-an-onboarding-buddy).
12. THe priviledge of being a PhD or postdoc comes with the responsibility of attending weekly lab meeting regularly, and presenting at lab meeting once per cycle. 


# Other

## Brave Space



A brave space is one which abides by the following tenets:
- “Controversy with civility,” where varying opinions are accepted
- “Owning intentions and impacts,” in which students acknowledge and discuss instances where a dialogue has affected the emotional well-being of another person
- “Challenge by choice,” where students have an option to step in and out of challenging conversations
- “Respect,” where students show respect for one another’s basic personhood
- “No attacks,” where students agree not to intentionally inflict harm on one another 

A commitment to D&I includes a commitment to not  use sexual language, imagery, or <a href="https://www.sph.umn.edu/site/docs/hewg/microaggressions.pdf">racial microaggressions</a> at any NeuroData sactioned event or content, including: code,
talks, presentations, demos,  hackathons,  workshops, social gatherings, social media, or any other online media.

We agree to dress appropriately in lab spaces (both physical and virtual). Lab members are expected to be fully clothed in the work environment (including virtual meetings). Clothing with offensive or inappropriate designs or stamps should not at official lab gatherings or when representing the lab in any capacity.
We also agree to avoid using profane language in public comments, code, or PRs.

To support this goal, we encourage all lab members to attend diversity training opportunities hosted by the university (e.g., [Safe Zone Training](https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/lgbtq/education/safe-zone/)). Our purpose in attending diversity training is to gain knowledge and skills we can use to co-create a welcoming and productive lab environment for people of all backgrounds. 

The lab website will display badges for all members who have completed any such training, to express our commitment to diversity and inclusion.
