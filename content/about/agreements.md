[TOC]

> COMMITMENT: A value we hold and abide by.
> AGREEMENT: A specific action that we will perform as stated. 

The below commitments and agreements are designed to facilitate each of us individually and collectively succeeding at our mission while in mind, body, spirit alignment. They are in a continual process of refinement; in life, work, and science, we experiment, learn, and grow. Note that these commitments and agreements *augment*, and therefore do not replace, official JHU policies, including:

1. The rights and responsibilities of all JHU students (documented [here](http://web.jhu.edu/administration/provost/docs/Rights_Responsibilities_Final.pdf)). 
2. JHU advisor-PhD student relationships commitments set forth by the [University Provost](https://provost.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/08/JHU-Mentorship-Commitments-of-Faculty-Advisors-and-PhD-Students.pdf). 
3. [University's policies on Academic Freedom](http://web.jhu.edu/administration/provost/initiatives/academicfreedom/AcademicFreedomatJohnsHopkins.pdf).


Joining the lab, which is made official by signing documents with JHU where JHU commits to you, amounts to also agreeing to all of the below core commitments and agreements.  If any individual is not acting in a fashion that is consistent with the NeuroData family commitments or agreements, that indicates that our environment is not adequately supportive of their flourishing, and therefore, we will seek to find something more in alignment with them (which could happen by modifying the commitments and agreements, or supporting them to find an opportunity that is more supportive of them).



## Jovo 
### Commitments 

For everybody in the [NeuroData family](https://neurodata.io/about/team/), for the duration of your tenure as a team member:

> I commit to flow in, and expand, our individual and collective flourishing I commit to supporting all the members of the NeuroData family to flow in, and expand, your individual and collective flourishing.  
 
Implicit in this commitment is an acknowledgement that each of us defines flourishing and collective for ourselves, thus I commit to support you in *your* definition of flourishing and collective, not mine. 

> I commit to providing the financial resources appropriate for your position, potentially including salary, benefits,  computing costs, conference fees, travel expenses, publication fees, etc.  

Note that additional fees never effect your salary.

> I commit to providing direction and guidance to the best of my abilities in support of your growth and maturation as a student, scientist, and human being.  

At various times, this will translate into me being a:

    1. coach: in which encouragement you & facilitate self-empowerment,
    2. challenger: in which I catalyze you to take action,
    3. creator: in which I co-create with you to manifest our desired outcomes. 

This commitment includes me *not* being any of the following:

    1. victim: in which I fail to take responsibility for my part of outcomes,
    1. villain: in which I blame others for various outcomes,
    2. hero: in which I seek temporary relief, rather than empowerment.  

> I commit to maintaining lab diversity writ large, including age, seniority, intellectual interests and background, sex, sexual/romantic orientation, gender, ethnicity, race, country of origin, ability, etc.


### Agreements

2. I will spend at least 1 hour per week with each PhD student every week, except for weeks that I am traveling, or the week is short due to academic calendar days off. 

1. In the event it seems to me that you are not meeting our agreements, I will candidly and compassionate share my perspective with you, owning my part and acknowledging all stories and feelings as such.  Such conversations may lead to changes in both of our perspectives, behaviors, and roles. 

I expect to meet all of these commitments 90% of the time.  I hope that whenever I fail to meet any of these commitments in any way, that you share your perspective with me, so that I may learn and grow from your perspective, no matter what it is. 


## NeuroData Family

The following commitments and agreements apply to all current members of the [NeuroData family](https://neurodata.io/about/team/), Jovo included

### Commitments

#### Genius

> I commit to focusing the majority of my research [energy](http://a.co/aPrBEkq) on a single project in my  [zone of genius](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S7L6FV2?ref=KC_GS_GB_US), and to support and inspire others to fully express their creativity and live in their zone of genius.

The overlap condition ensures that Jovo can provide appropriate support and guidance, as otherwise, he is not within his zone of genius. Abiding by this commitment requires assessing your zone of genius. Note that this commitment leaves plenty of room to work on non-lab stuff, and play. 


#### Maximally Intrinsically Motivated for Successful Mission Critical Research

> I commit to focus my primary research project on work that I am intrinsically motivated to complete, and given our time, energy, expertise, and other resources. I commit to focusing on a project that I estimate is likely to be successful and impactful with regard to our mission. 

See [how to choose a project](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/08/31/sig-and-feas.html) for more tips on how to choose a project. In general, each project should take about 1 year to make public (e.g., post to arXiv), and is complete when the manuscript is published in a journal/conference. 


#### Open, Accessible, & Reproducible Science

> I commit to conducting my work using the highest standards for open, accessible, and reproducible science. 

##### Code

This means that our work will result in open source code, open access data derivatives, and open access publication (posting to a pre-print server) no later than journal submission, and ideally, throughout the entire scientific process. Code will only be not open source if there are external reasons (e.g., patient privacy, external collaborator insistence). 


When contributing code to widely used open-source libraries, I will:

  1. ensure that I am a member of the [`neurodata`](https://github.com/neurodata) organization on Github, and make my membership status public.
  2. Preface my issue or devlist email with the following:

    - My name is [name here] and I am a member of @neurodata of Johns Hopkins University. We design, build, study, and apply statistical machine learning and big data science techniques, and are highly active in the open source community. You can find a list of our open source contributions [here](https://neurodata.io/code/). 

Following these steps will add credibility to my contribution, and make it more likely for my issue to be accepted, and my PR to be reviewed.

This also includes adopting best practices for diversity and inclusion in all of our activities. For example, see [https://github.com/mozilla/inclusion] for some examples with respect to code, and we make figures that are color-blind sensitive, use >10 point font, etc. All repo's that we maintain officially (i.e., that are mentioned in a pre-print/paper) will be maintained according to [FIRM standards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MEloi0hGa8IhwxE-HXdklAUoftTJGw-E_VliEqez150/edit?usp=sharing). 

##### Papers

Crucially, posting to pre-print servers, and submitting to journals, do *not* explicitly require supervisor approval of the content. Rather, assuming the [recommended guidelines](https://bitsandbrains.io/2019/02/10/how-to-write-a-paper.html) are followed, then all lab co-authors have 1 week to provide feedback and modification requests. After another week passes, the manuscript may be submitted and the pre-print may be posted, even in the absence of further feedback from any lab members (including Jovo). Note that collaborators outside the lab are not beholden to this agreement. If for some reason a lab member cannot be reached during this time, we can still post/submit, but agree to remove said lab person from the co-author list if they so choose within 1 week of their return. One week extensions can be granted to lab members if necessary, but only one week extension is permissable. 

Prompt feedback is critical both for producing a quality manuscript and for sustaining forward movement on a project. Our lab-internal one-week feedback policy is intended to keep projects moving forward *AND* solicit the necessary feedback to produce high-quality papers. Importantly, this is only an expectation NeuroData members have agreed to meet. When NeuroData members are the first and/or last authors of a manuscript, consider requesting your collaborators also adhere to this lab policy. When a NeuroData member is a middle author on an outside group's manuscript, consider proactively requesting reviews of any drafts prior to submission and promise feedback in no more than one week. If a shorter timeline is required, try to be as accommodating as possible. As individuals and as a lab, it is our professional responsibility to know what is in a manuscript that carries our names, so it is appropriate to request that co-authors share final manuscripts with us prior to submission.



#### Diversity and Inclusion 

> I commit to co-creating a safe and comfortable environment, and harassment-free experience (see [wikipedia's definition of harrassment for details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harassment)), for everyone, regardless of the following
sex,
gender,
gender identity and expression,
age,
sexual orientation,
marital status, pregnancy, 
disability,
physical appearance,
body size,
race,
ethnicity,
nationality,
religion,
political views,
veteran status,
experience or lack of,
or other historically and contemporaneously marginalized identity. 

We recognize the unique struggles of being a member of a marginalized community (and all the more so for individuals that are members of multiple such communities) in STEM and are committed to creating a environment where everyone feels supported, appreciated, and welcome. This includes:

- accomodating student needs so that they feel safe in lab and on campus
- connecting students with relevant affinity groups on campus as desired

To support this goal we encourage all lab members to attend diversity training opportunities hosted by the university (e.g., [Safe Zone Training](https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/lgbtq/education/safe-zone/)). Our purpose in attending diversity training is to gain knowledge and skills we can use to co-create a welcoming and productive lab environment for people of all backgrounds. 

The lab website will display badges for all members who have completed any such training, to express to the world our commitment to diversity and inclusion. 

#### Honesty

> I commit to speaking inarguably/impeccably, including acknowledging all authentic feelings, expressing the inarguble truth and keeping my agreements. 

This means that we use "I" statements, such as "I heard X", rather than "You said X", and "My judgement of you is that you are X", rather than "You are X".  See this definition of [impeccable agreements](http://www.toltecspirit.com/four-agreements/impeccable-word/).


#### Play

> I commit to play by honoring rest, renewal and rhythm.

Stuart Brown defines play in his book as “an absorbing, apparently purposeless activity that provides enjoyment and suspends self-consciousness and a sense of time. It is also self-motivating and makes you want to do it again.”

Manifestations of play include participating in daily recess (3pm daily on school days), and/or other regular social/playful events.  Some styles of play include

- JOKER: Play always revolves around some sort of nonsense. Making silly sounds with a child or playing a practical joke on a friend fall under this category. 
- KINESTHETE: Those in this group include athletes, dancers, and others who like to push their bodies and feel the result.
- EXPLORER: These people delight in trying new experiences, such as physically going to new places, emotionally exploring and deepening feelings, and mentally researching or discovering new points of view. 
- COMPETITOR: This person enjoys a competitive game with specific rules and loves fighting for number one! 
- DIRECTOR: These players like planning and executing scenes and events. They are born organizers who give parties and instigate group events. 
- COLLECTOR: This type of player relishes the thrill of having the most and best collection of objects or experiences, such as antiques, cars, or wine. 
- ARTIST/CREATOR: This person’s joy comes from making things. Sculpting, woodworking, sewing, and gardening are a few examples. The point is to make something beautiful or functional. 
- STORYTELLER: Here the imagination is the key to the kingdom of play. This group includes novelists, cartoonists, and screenwriters as well as those who like reading stories and watching movies. They are also the performers who use dance, magic, and acting to create an imaginative world.

#### Brave space

> I commit to co-creating the lab as a [_brave space_](https://www.naspa.org/images/uploads/main/Policy_and_Practice_No_2_Safe_Brave_Spaces.pdf).

A brave space is one which abides by the following tenets:
- “Controversy with civility,” where varying opinions are accepted
- “Owning intentions and impacts,” in which students acknowledge and discuss instances where a dialogue has affected the emotional well-being of another person
- “Challenge by choice,” where students have an option to step in and out of challenging conversations
- “Respect,” where students show respect for one another’s basic personhood
- “No attacks,” where students agree not to intentionally inflict harm on one another 

Lab members are free to profess any belief and debate any issue they choose provided they continuously demonstrate respect for each other. Disagreement can be productive as it can help us gain perspective for another point of view, examine our own beliefs and opinions, and look for common ground. Disagreement in a respectful environment is an opportunity for collective growth. These benefits are overshadowed, however, when debates become attacks and we cease to show respect for each other.
This also means that there is a responsibility on the offended party to make the offender aware of their offense if they would like change.
People who choose to talk about challenging topics around you do not have priority in the workspace and you can always ask a group to leave.
Respect implies that when someone asks you do something reasonable, like stop talking about a certain topic or to talk somewhere else, you respect them and their boundaries.
"No attacks" implies no malicious intent directed at anyone. Pointing out shortcomings via constructive criticism is possible to perceive as an attack, but we commit to assume the best of our peers. We should feel free to clarify with anyone, at any time, if a comment is intended as an attack or not. Clarifying intent is likely to alleviate harmful misconceptions.
Nobody is perfect, and we will work with each other to make our work environment better.

#### Feedback

> I commit to providing authentic feedback about my experience of them, while owning my projections and my responsibility for co-creating this situation. I commit to sharing feedback directly to the people with whom I have an issue or concern, and encouraging others to talk directly to people with whom they have an issue or concern.

The model for feedback we use is the Conscious Leadership Group's [clearing model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3o2js6vme2zh3fu/CLG-Clearing%20Model.pdf?dl=1).  It is commonly best practice to provide such feedback in private. 


Feedback for Jovo can be provided directly in the #jovofeedback slack channel, the [anonymous feedback form](https://forms.gle/6CZDgEHKuUhWh8Su7), or by scheduling a [one-on-one meeting]((https://calendly.com/joshuav)) with Jovo (the preferred format).

### Agreements

#### Paper writing

We agree that when it is time to start writing a paper, clone our [latex template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mnmbyrtgphkp) overleaf repo, invite Jovo to it and make him owner so that compilation goes faster and we can track changes. If a collaborator prefers google docs for some reason, we will strive to come to a consensus agreement (and defer to the senior author's choice if we cannot reach a concensus). In general, when anybody gives feedback on the paper, track changes. Consider giving feedback via the following convention: 

% TODO blah blah ---jovo

This enables everyone to easily find all the comments, including if they are editing locally (or simply not in the overleaf web app). When feedback is provided, it is important to address every single comment *in the text itself*. Recall: the author of a manuscript is literally the least qualified person in the world to ascertain whether what that person has written is *clear to other people*, which is the question at hand. Therefore, if you are the author, and you think it was clear, *you are wrong*, in that it certainly was not clear to at least one person that cares. 

#### Cloud computing

We agree to use cloud computing on services with existing credits prior to using paid credits.   For AWS, the prerequisite to using it is writing (not winning) an [AWS Cloud Credits for Research grant](https://aws.amazon.com/research-credits/). Request just under $10,000 for small projects, and request up to $100,000 for larger ones. For the Brainlit project, we have an NIH grant, and that is what we should be using entirely until it runs out of money. However, anyone who is using cloud computing should first check that it runs on a small dataset prior to running overnight. 


#### Buddies 

We agree that when each trainee reaches a certain level of seniority on the team (have successfully submitted >=1 first author peer-reviewed manuscript on our team), we will be open to accepting a "buddy" mentee. Our responsibility associated with this mentee will be to onboard the mentee. There is lots of literature to suggest this is good for everyone on the team, for example, see [here](https://hbr.org/2018/12/to-retain-new-hires-spend-more-time-onboarding-them) and [here](https://hbr.org/2019/06/every-new-employee-needs-an-onboarding-buddy).

#### Collaboration

We agree to reach out to potential collaborators when we find any information that may be useful for the lab such as algorithms or public code we want to incorporate into our package. Invite them to co-author any papers we produce, and in general include them in our community. 


#### Respect

We agree to not include or use sexual language, imagery, or <a href="https://www.sph.umn.edu/site/docs/hewg/microaggressions.pdf">racial microaggressions</a> at any NeuroData sactioned event or content, including: code,
talks, presentations, demos,  hackathons,  workshops, social gatherings, social media, or any other online media.

We agree to dress appropriately in lab spaces (both physical and virtual). Lab members are expected to be fully clothed in the work environment (including virtual meetings). Clothing with offensive or inappropriate designs or stamps should not be worn when interacting with lab members or representing the lab in any capacity.
We also agree to avoid using profane language in public comments, code, or PRs.

(Much of this language is taken from <a href="https://hackcodeofconduct.org/">hack code of conduct</a>.)



#### Contacting People Outside the Lab With Questions

We agree that contacting people outside the lab with questions is effectively asking them to spend their limited time helping us. Since we would prefer to be the ones offering help rather than receiving it, we agree, prior to asking them for help, to:

  1. Consider what it would take for us to solve our problem (this means searching the literature, exploring and writing code, reading books, etc).
  2. Consider what it would take for peers within the lab to help with our problem (this means asking labmates for help or literature recommendations, or asking jovo for help or literature recommendations).
  3. Make a judgement call that the ratio of the effort required in #1 or #2 to the effort required to contact someone outside the lab is high enough to justify the potential cost to their time.

If we do have to ask people outside the lab questions, we agree to make sure to clarify to them the extent to which we are grateful for their time, and that we have exhausted our internal resources prior to reaching out. Any questions we ask should be about pointing us in the right direction, rather than asking for a time to speak with them.

#### Contributing to Widely Used Open-Source Libraries


### Regular Activities

#### Daily Presence

Our experience dictates that in person communication and happenstance meetings can dramatically increase our productivity. At the same time, many of us need some time to think or write in quiet, often in isolation. Therefore, we have found that a balance of the two is optimal for everyone (so far). The particular distribution of time alone vs. with the team is idiosyncratic per person. To respect the individual with the goals of the team we each agree:

- Be physically in the lab 2+ days/week for all full weeks in the academic calendar
- Work 40 hours per week, approximately 50 weeks per year, on our primary research projects.
- Conduct at least half of one's daily work during typical hours (approximately 10am to 6pm Eastern Time, Monday to Friday on all days JHU is open).
- Respond to one another within one school day. 
- Other hours/days: there is no expectation of responding to email/slack.
- When posting in channels, keep messages concise and professional. 
- While people are in the lab, we will not intentially interrupt/disturb other people if their headphones are on (or they provide another indicator that they are working).
- Any questions that result in a conversation (rather than a simple answer) will not happen in the lab area, but rather, the lounge, in kavli, etc. 


Your most valuable resource while on this team is the team itself.

We agree that in the rare event that a supervisor requests your presence in the lab for a particular time/day, we will make our best efforts to be there, barring family responsibilities overruling research priorities. This includes: impending grants, conferences, or other internally/externally imposed deadline.


#### Weekly Lab Meetings


We agree to have 1 hour for informal talks, Q&A, and lunch all weeks that JHU is open (including summers, unless otherwise specified). We agree to **practice** before getting in front of 10-20 people, because every minute you speak you have implicitly asked many other people to devote to you, so please be respectful of other people's time. Each of us will present about 2x / year, depending on the size of the team. Swapping dates with other lab members will be allowed whenever it is mutually agreed upon. New lab members will be added to the beginning of the queue when they join, and will be required to present their life story while wearing a funny hat. Team members can sign up for a slot [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pysmRprg6r2ToyddZhNx3AqCHm2aeHUy949h4KkcQso/edit?usp=sharing).


#### Annual Group Hangouts

To build community and deeper inter-personal connections, and to have fun, we agree to having annual activities like going to dinner as a team. These occasions will include a celebration of past successes, as well as a discussion of collective goals for the subsequent year. These occasions will be organized by trainees.


#### Semi-Annual No JoVo Meeting

We will meet at least 2x annual without jovo to discuss ways we can collectively improve the lab, and provide detailed and [radically candid](https://www.radicalcandor.com/) feedback.


#### Annual Reviews

We agree to annual reviews, to document goals and assess trajectory, by filling out either the following [questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/U5relYG8tV3fECqL2), or the BME PhD student questionnaire, annually, and then scheduling a meeting with Jovo to discuss. These meetings will typically happen in July. 

#### Agreements update

We agree to update these Agreements as appropriate.

#### Research Artifacts 

We agree to the contributing to the following research artifacts, depending on the "stage" of our careers, and our career objectives. We have different milestones and deliverables, but annual productivity is a crucial component of any career development.

##### Publications

- *MSE thesis students* and *Research staff*: submit a first author publication each year
- *PhD students*: submit a first author publication once per each of the last three years of the PhD
- *Postdocs*: submit a first author publication once per year

> Quotes can be a useful device in adding style or establishing context in scientific writing, so we fully support and encourage including quotes in our papers; and, we aspire to include quotes from individuals with diverse backgrounds who live(d) the highest moral standards and serve as role models for us. At the same time, we acknowledge that quotes can come across as an endorsement of the personal life of the author. Therefore, quotes should be carefully chosen and considered by all authors of a paper. Any quote from a non-scientist will be held to a very high moral standard. 

##### Conferences

We agree to present at >=1 conference per year to get feedback, network, and professional development. Any conferences one desires to attend is fine, conditional on

- applying to present your work via some mechanism (posters, talks, or boothing), and
- for conferences with proceedings, a "submission ready" draft is provided >= 1 month prior to submission deadline, or
- for conferences with posters, a "presentation ready" poster is provided >= 2 weeks prior to the event.

##### Grants

We (postdocs) agree to apply for funding each year, targeting a solicitation >2 months in advance. 

We (anybody using "extensive" commercial cloud computing (>$1,000/month)) will write a AWS Research credits grant at least annually for <$10,000. 


#### Departure Agreements

We agree to make a 'transition' plan no later than 3 months prior to departure, wherein the technical expertise we have acquired in the lab is transferred to at least one individual in the lab. This includes, 
- If we have written a numerical package, that the core components of it are integrated into another package, so maintanence is no longer dependent on us;
- A plan for how to address completing papers that are not yet 'done' (where done means we've already sent proofs back). This includes identifying an indivudal who will be the point of contact for future correspondence with journals, etc. Authorship inclusion and order may change in this process, including elevating/relegating to/from first author, as deemed appropriate by the corresponding author. 

#### Authorship Agreements

Typically, the person actually submitting the paper is the first author. This means that sometimes, if we get feedback after an individual has left the lab, and that person decides to prioritize other work, the 2nd author may be responsible for resubmitting, and the author order may switch accordingly.

#### Communication

The primary ways for a NeuroData family member to contact Jovo is at their weekly 1-on-1 in person meetings. Time permitting, other slots may be available in [calendly](https://calendly.com/joshuav/).


#### Accessibility

We agree to use closed captioning technology when presenting our work virtually, whenever possible. Videoconference technology can make it especially hard for deaf, hard of hearing, and/or non-native English speakers to understand speech. Such technology is available on Google slides, and Microsoft Office 365. In order to make this practice maximally effective, we strive to:

- keep captioning on even during question and answer periods
- link audio output to input, so the captioning can pick up speech from the audience. This can be done by playing audio out loud through computer speakers, or by using software such as [this](https://webcaptioner.com/help/integrations/captioning-audio-from-another-program-microphone).


#### Summer Community Outreach

We agree to support >= 1 summer student each summer. There are a variety of summer mentorship opportunities in partnership with some Baltimore public education institution (e.g. state university, public high school) that can foster stronger connections with our surrounding community. Examples include:

- ICM Summer Internship with UMBC or Morgan State - [website](https://icm.jhu.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/internships/)
- Mentor student from local college through JHMI Summer Internship Program - [website](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/Opportunities-High-School-Undergraduate-Postbac-Students/)
- Research experience for women in Baltimore City schools through WSE's WISE program - [website](https://engineering.jhu.edu/outreach/get-involved/women-in-science-and-engineering-wise-program/)
- Volunteering at CodeScholar, a summer bootcamp for Baltimore School System students - [website](https://www.codeintheschools.org/codescholar)


#### Recommended Reading on Mentorship and Imposter Syndrome

Mentors can anticipate that many of their mentees may experience imposter syndrome. This can be compounded by stereotype threat and experiences of discrimination that have happened in the past or their current environment (which should be addressed by the team). Mentors can support their mentees (and vice versa) by educating themselves on imposter syndrome’s causes, indications, and counteractive tools or practices. Mentors can thus learn to listen in a new way to their mentees and validate their experiences, to use positive and constructive feedback to affirm their value, to share their own uncertainties and learning process, and to ask if their mentees would like support in connecting with resources such as affinity networks for people with shared experiences or articles with tools for managing imposter syndrome. 

The following resources are recommended to all lab members, especially to those who serve as mentors. They are also encouraged to seek additional resources to learn how to create an equitable and supportive lab environment.

- [mentoring someone with imposter syndrome](https://hbr.org/2019/02/mentoring-someone-with-imposter-syndrome)
- [mitigating imposter syndrome](https://www.usenix.org/blog/impostor-syndrome-proof-yourself-and-your-community)
- [the minority experience and imposter syndrome](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/smarter-living/dealing-with-impostor-syndrome-when-youre-treated-as-an-impostor.html)

### Individual Commitments to Upholding Agreements
Certain agreements require a member of the lab to commit to be an organizer. Each year, a new member of the lab will commit for the following year or until someone else agrees to take responsibility. The following individuals are currently committed to upholding the listed aspects of the lab agreement.

- Weekly lab meeting: Ross
- Semi-annual social events: Ronan
- Semi-annual no-jovo meetings: Pedigo 
- Annual lab trip: Sambit
- Internship outreach and management: Tommy

### Birthday Privileges
On the day of a lab members' birthday, all other members shall refer to them as "Your Supreme Superbity." Also, all lab members must spontaneously breakout into an enthusiastic chicken dance at their command.
